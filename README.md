# Hello-World
getting started with github, learning its features, keeping notes and ideas stored.

Hello, Gitmasters!

My name is abrokenportal. Thats what i refere to myself as anyways when i'm manifesting through the digital world. It's somewhat synonomous or symbolically related to a 404error code lol. So i'll bet you probably catch my drift at this point. Enough about my name. I just want to learn coding in general as well as this amazing platform or should i say very well working portal. My primary focus will be on learning the languages Python as well as Linux. 

Thank you for all your help and willingness to teach me!

Sincerely, 

abrokenportal
